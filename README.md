# **UBER and LYFT Fare Price Prediction**

## **Objective**

The objective of this project is to create a fare price prediction model for ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft in the greater Boston area. The model aims to predict the fare price for a given ride based on various attributes and features.

## **Data Analysis**

### Data Exploration

The project starts with an analysis of the provided dataset to understand its structure and content. Key questions are addressed regarding the data, such as the amount of available data, continuous valued features, and categorical attributes.

### Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing phase involves handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding. The continuous features are also standardized using the StandardScaler.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The EDA phase involves visualizing the data to gain insights into its distribution and relationships between different attributes. Pair plots, histograms, and scatter plots are used to understand the data's characteristics.

## **Feature Engineering**

Outliers in the price column are identified and treated by replacing them with the mean value. Additionally, a correlation matrix is computed to identify relationships between attributes and labels.

## **Model Training and Evaluation**

### Linear Regression Models

Multiple linear regression models are trained using various techniques, including:

- Standard Linear Regression (Closed Form)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regression
- Polynomial Regression

These models are evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on both training and validation sets.

### Regularization Techniques

- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net Regression

Regularization techniques are applied to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization. Different hyperparameter values are tested, and their impact on the model's performance is assessed.

### K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-Fold cross-validation is employed to evaluate model performance across different folds of the dataset. This provides a robust assessment of model generalization.

## **Conclusion and Next Steps**

The project has successfully developed and evaluated several fare price prediction models for ride-hailing services. The Linear Regression model with Ridge regularization has shown promising results in terms of both accuracy and generalization. The project could be extended further with the following steps:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional feature transformations or interactions that might capture more complex relationships in the data.

2. **Advanced Algorithms**: Experiment with more complex algorithms such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, or Neural Networks to further improve predictive performance.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct an extensive hyperparameter search to fine-tune models and achieve better performance.

4. **External Data Sources**: Integrate external data sources such as traffic patterns, events, or holidays that might affect fare prices.

5. **Dynamic Pricing Model**: Develop a dynamic pricing model that takes into account real-time demand and supply factors to predict fare prices accurately.

6. **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface where users can input ride details to get fare price predictions.

7. **Deployment**: Deploy the final model as a service accessible via API for integration with ride-hailing platforms.

8. **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously monitor and update the model as new data becomes available to ensure its accuracy over time.

By addressing these steps, the fare price prediction model can be further refined and provide valuable insights for ride-hailing companies to optimize their pricing strategies.
